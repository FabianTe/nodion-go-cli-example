# Nodion Go CLI Example

**Warning** This template is not yet usable. I am still working on getting both an API and a Worker context working.

This is my personal template for deploying a Go CLI on [Nodion](https://www.nodion.com).

Use it as starting point if you want to deploy a Go application based on a Dockerfile. This may be useful when
you need a special environment with additional linux packages etc.
